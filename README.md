web-core, a filehost web app, that allows anyone to upload files via an API.
Files are hashed and uploaded to public file hosting. Using the hashes a node
can look up the information of where that file was stored using the
[Datacoin](http://datacoin.info/) blockchain. This makes a file uploaded to
MetaDisk accessible through any node in the network.

- Coded in [Python](http://python.org/) and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), a Python microframework for web.
- Must be run on a Linux based web server, [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) distro recommended.

#### Web interface

If you wish to use this in a browser, take a look at
[MetaDisk](https://github.com/Storj/Metadisk). It is a web interface,
composed of only html, css and javascript, powered by the web-core API.


#### Scope

This project depends on several other projects:

- [plowshare-wrapper](https://github.com/Storj/plowshare-wrapper) provides a
  python interface to upload and download files from popular file hosting
  sites. It is a python wrapper of the plowshare tool.

- [cloud-manager](https://github.com/Storj/cloud-manager) contains most of the
  file handling logic. It keeps track of all the uploaded files, keeps track of
  the files present in local cache, and handles database serialization.

- [metachains](https://github.com/Storj/metachains) is a wrapper for
  the Florincoin client, using json RPC. It also contains a synchronization class,
  which allows one to synchronize data from and to the blockchain.

- [file-encryptor](https://github.com/Storj/file-encryptor) is an encryption
  package that implements convergent encryption using HMAC-SHA256 and AES128-CTR.

This project puts everything together and makes it accessible through a web
application. It uses `cloudmanager` to manage all uploads/downloads, and
`metachains-dtc` to enable synchronization of the hosted content information
between nodes running MetaDisk. All uploaded files are encrypted using
`file-encryptor`.


#### Synchronization note

Keep in mind that the `upload` command spends datacoins, so be careful when
using it.

#### Transfer cost

Each time you upload or download a file, credit is removed from your account.
The credited values vary wether you are uploading or downloading a file, and
if the file is already present on the server or not.

Uploading a file of B bytes will cost you ```4 * B``` bytes of credit. One
time for the upload transfer and three times for the cloud hosting transfer.

Downloading a file of B bytes will cost you ```2 * B``` bytes of credit if the
file is not on the server's local cache. If it is, this value will be reduced
to ```B``` bytes of credit.
